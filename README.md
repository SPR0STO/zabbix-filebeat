# Filebeat Zabbix Template

Zabbix plugin for basic "filebeat" monitoring. 

## Features:

- Checking if filebeat service is not active on the machine and alert with a 
trigger; 
- Checking if filebeat version is changed on the machine and alert with a 
trigger; 
- Checking if no data about filebeat service status or filebeat version on the 
machine and alert with a trigger. 

## Requirements

- Linux OS on a filebeat node with zabbix agent installed.

## Installation

This only needs to be setup on the filebeat node and zabbix-server.

### Zabbix Agent

Copy filebeat.conf to conf.d or add UserParameter to your agent config.

### Zabbix Frontend

Import the filebeat.xml template (supports zabbix 3.4 and greater).
Add node to the newly imported template.

## Important note

This is a very little and basic plugin I wrote to monitor my resources. I just 
wanted to share this if you also need a handy and simple plugin to check some 
filebeat info.
