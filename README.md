# Filebeat Zabbix Template

Basic filebeat monitoring plugin for zabbix

## Features:

## Requirements

## Installation

This only needs to be setup on the filebeat node.

### Zabbix Frontend

Import the filebeat.xml template (supports zabbix 3.4 and greater).
Add node to the newly imported template.

## Important note

This is a very little and basic plugin I wrote to monitor my resources. I just 
wanted to share this if you also need a handy and simple plugin to check some 
filebeat info.
